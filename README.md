Here is the link to the simple web server I based this file system off of: https://aosabook.org/en/500L/a-simple-web-server.html

Cloud file system where the end user can create directories, store files, and move files to/from a directory

1. File system must function with the user's read, write, and list the files in a directory
2. File system should be able to serve multiple users
3. File system must be remotely accessible from anywhere on the Internet

How to use the file system:
1. Run the program from the command line: $ python3 SimpleServer.py
2. Go to a web browser and type: localhost:8080
3.
